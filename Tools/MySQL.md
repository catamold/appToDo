## MySQL Workbench
**MySQL Workbench** is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more.

MySQL Workbench enables a DBA, developer, or data architect to visually design, model, generate, and manage databases. It includes everything a data modeler needs for creating complex _ER models_, forward and reverse engineering, and also delivers key features for performing difficult change management and documentation tasks that normally require much time and effort.

MySQL Workbench delivers visual tools for creating, executing, and optimizing SQL queries. The SQL Editor provides color syntax highlighting, auto-complete, reuse of SQL snippets, and execution history of SQL.

MySQL Workbench provides a visual console to easily administer MySQL environments and gain better visibility into databases.
