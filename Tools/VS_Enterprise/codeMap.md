## Code Map
Code maps help us see how the code fits together without reading through files and lines of code. This tool is offered by Visual Studio Enterprise called **Code Map**. The code map can be created from an empty code map and dragging items onto it, including assembly references, files and folders, or you can generate a code map for all or part of your solution.
