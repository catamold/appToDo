## CodeLens
Having a good application structure is very hard to follow when it has many functionalities. A powerful tool is offered by Visual Studio Enterprise called **CodeLens**. It lets you stay focused on your work while you find out what happened to your code, without leaving the editor. You can find references to a piece of code, changes to your code, linked bugs, work items, code reviews, and unit tests.
