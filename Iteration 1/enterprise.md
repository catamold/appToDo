## Code Map
Code maps help us see how the code fits together without reading through files and lines of code. This tool is offered by Visual Studio Enterprise called **Code Map**. The code map can be created from an empty code map and dragging items onto it, including assembly references, files and folders, or you can generate a code map for all or part of your solution.

## CodeLens
Having a good application structure is very hard to follow when it has many functionalities. A powerful tool is offered by Visual Studio Enterprise called **CodeLens**. It lets you stay focused on your work while you find out what happened to your code, without leaving the editor. You can find references to a piece of code, changes to your code, linked bugs, work items, code reviews, and unit tests.
