## OO Principles
Object Oriented Principles were used in designing the application:
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* TDD (Test - Driven Development)

Having a good application structure is very hard to follow when it has many functionalities. A powerful tool is offered by Visual Studio Enterprise called **CodeLens**. It lets you stay focused on your work while you find out what happened to your code, without leaving the editor. You can find references to a piece of code, changes to your code, linked bugs, work items, code reviews, and unit tests.

## OOP Paradigms
Application was designed using the following OOP paradigms:
* Inheritance -> One object acquires all the properties and behavior of parent object
* Polymorphism -> One task is performed by different ways (overloading and overriding)

_Overloading:_ It allows a class to have more than one method/constructor having the same name and different argument lists
* Abstraction -> Hiding internal details and showing functionality (using abstract class and interface)
* Encapsulation -> Wrapping code and data together into a single unit. We declare the variables of a class as private and provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values
