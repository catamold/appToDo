## Forms
The application interface was created using Visual Studio Windows Forms. Each form has a start position to the center of the screen.

**Reminders:** This is the main page of the application. Users can choose between one of the six workspaces (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Anytime,Someday, Logbook) in order sort their reminders. A new feature was added so that users can find some specific tasks just by typing some keywords.

**TaskForm:** First step for a new reminder is to complete some of the fields like title, priority, date, note's text and tags.

**NoteForm:** This page was designed for fast viewing the reminder as a well designed form.
