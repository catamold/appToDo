## Tools and Programming languages
This application was made using C# programming language (Visual Studio Enterprise). All the data are stored in a database, so that it makes it easier for searching different data (MySQL Workbench - SQL). A layer of protection was implemented for making the application more safe. A user privilege has the mission to protect sensitive data, which will be used to validate the login information. An XML file is used to store encrypted data like users and passwords. As a result all data stored by users like personal reminders, will be protected under this user privilege. The local-server was created using XAMPP application (Apache).
