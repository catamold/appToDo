## Release
Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important, so we can mark release points. After that we can create a release to provide packaged software, release notes, and binary files for other people to use. Releases are based on Git tags, which mark a specific point in your repository's history and they are ordered by the date they are created on GitHub. The first release of the application was created after one week as [v0.1](https://github.com/ps-ds-lab/2019-30235-catamold/releases/tag/v0.1).
