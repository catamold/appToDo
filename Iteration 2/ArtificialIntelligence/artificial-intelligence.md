## Artificial Intelligence

**Auto-complete**

Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In graphical user interfaces, users can typically press the space key to accept a suggestion. Autocomplete speeds up human-computer interactions when it correctly predicts the word a user intends to enter after only a few characters have been typed into a text input field.

**Abbreviations**

An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase.

**Text analysis**

Text analysis is the automated process of obtaining information from text. In short, text analysis (a.k.a. text mining) is the automated process that allows machines to extract and classify information from text, such as reminders.

## Methods and Techniques
**Text Extraction**

It involves extracting pieces of data that already exist within any given text such as date or location. These data will be used further for weather information.

**Keyword Extraction**

Keywords are the most relevant terms within a text, terms that summarize the contents of text in list form. Keyword extraction can be used to index data to be searched and to generate tag clouds. For instancce hashtags.
