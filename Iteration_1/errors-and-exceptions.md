## Errors
Typing inappropriate data in some fields will result in not making any modification to the application data, but it may damage the user interface.

## Exceptions
Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch. Whenever inside a method, if an exception has occurred, the method creates an Object known as Exception Object and hands it off to the run-time system. The exception object contains name and description of the exception, and current state of the program where exception has occurred.
